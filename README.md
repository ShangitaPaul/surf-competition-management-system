# Sample Code:

**main.py:** 
- Provides basic structure for the SCMS. It includes functions for creating events, registering competitors, assigning judges, tracking scores, and generating reports. The main function of the code creates a new event, registers a competitor for the event, assigns a judge to the event, tracks the score of a wave ridden by the competitor, and generates a report on the results of the event.

- It will be extended to include additional features, such as the ability to manage multiple events, the ability to view and edit the data in the database, and the ability to customize the user interface.

**app.py:** 
- This code defines a simple Flask application that can be used to manage surf competitions. The application exposes two endpoints:

   - /events: This endpoint can be used to get a list of all events, or to create a new event.

   - /competitors: This endpoint can be used to get a list of all competitors, or to create a new competitor.

- The application uses a JSON file to store the data about events and competitors. The JSON file is opened and closed in each endpoint function, so that the data is always up-to-date.


# Surf Competition Management System (SCMS)

**THIS APP IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT***

The Surf Competition Management System (SCMS) is a Software application that helps organizers of surf competitions to manage all aspects of the competition, from registration and scheduling to scoring and results reporting.

The back end of an SCMS is responsible for storing and managing all of the data related to the competition, such as the competitors' information, the competition schedule, and the scoring results. The back end also provides APIs that allow the front end of the application to access and manipulate this data.

The back end of an SCMS can be developed using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Some popular choices include Java, Python, and PHP. The specific language or framework that is chosen will depend on the specific needs of the application and the skills of the development team.

The back end of an SCMS typically includes the following components:

- A database to store the competition data
- A web server to host the application
- An API to allow the front end of the application to access the data
- A scheduler to manage the competition schedule
- A scoring engine to calculate the results of the competition

The back end of an SCMS is a critical component of the application. It is responsible for storing and managing all of the data related to the competition, and it provides the APIs that allow the front end of the application to access and manipulate this data. The back end must be reliable and secure, as it is responsible for protecting the sensitive data of the competition participants.

Here are some of the benefits of using mostly back end development for a surf competition management system:

- It can be more scalable and efficient than a front-end-heavy approach.
- It can be more secure, as the sensitive data of the competition participants is stored and managed on the back end.
- It can be more cost-effective, as it requires less development and maintenance resources.
  
Overall, a surf competition management system that uses mostly back end development can be a more reliable, secure, and cost-effective solution for organizers of surf competitions.

Here are some additional features that could be included in the back end of a surf competition management system:

- A payment processing system to allow competitors to pay their registration fees online.
- A messaging system to allow organizers to communicate with competitors and spectators.
- A social media integration to allow competitors and spectators to share their experiences on social media.
- A sponsorship management system to allow organizers to find and manage sponsors for the competition.


The back-end development technologies that could be used for this project include:

- Programming language: The SCMS could be developed using a programming language such as Java, Python, or Ruby.
- Database: The SCMS would need to - store data about events, competitors, judges, and scores. This data could be stored in a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Web server: The SCMS would need to be hosted on a web server so that users can access it from the internet. The web server could be Apache, Nginx, or another popular web server.
  
The front-end development of the SCMS could be done using a variety of technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front-end development would focus on creating the user interface for the application, such as the forms for registering competitors and assigning judges.

The SCMS could be a valuable tool for surfing organizations and event organizers. It can help to streamline the management of surfing competitions and to provide a more efficient and transparent way to track the results of competitions.
